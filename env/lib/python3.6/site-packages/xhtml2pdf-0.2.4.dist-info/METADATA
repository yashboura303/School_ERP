   :alt: Documentation Status

The current release of xhtml2pdf is xhtml2pdf **0.2.1** which is the first stable
version that has Python 3 support. 
As with all open-source software, its use in production depends
on many factors, so be aware that you may find issues in some cases.
**Big thanks** to everyone
who has worked on this project so far and to those who help maintain it.



What else can you use instead?
==============================

Go use WeasyPrint, the codebase is pretty, it has a different features, and it
does a lot of what xhtml2pdf does and it is easier to use in many circumstances.

`WeasyPrint <http://weasyprint.org/>`__


Documentation?
==============

xhtml2pdf has some documentation, and we could use your help improving it.
A good place to start is ``doc/usage.rst``.

Or also see in `Readthedocs <http://xhtml2pdf.readthedocs.io//>`__


Call for testing
================

This project is heavily dependent on getting its test coverage up!
Currently, Python 3 support is being worked on and many refactors and suggestions are potentially coming in.
Furthermore, parts of the codebase could do well with cleanups and refactoring.

If you benefit from xhtml2pdf, perhaps `look at the test coverage <https://coveralls.io/github/xhtml2pdf/xhtml2pdf?branch=master>`__ and identify parts that are yet untouched.


About
=====

``xhtml2pdf`` is a html2pdf converter using the ReportLab Toolkit,
the HTML5lib and pyPdf. It supports HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS 3).
It is completely written in pure Python so it is platform independent.

The main benefit of this tool that a user with Web skills like HTML and CSS
is able to generate PDF templates very quickly without learning new
technologies.


Installation
============

This is a typical Python library and is installed using pip::

    pip install xhtml2pdf


Requirements
============

Python 2.7+. Only Python 3.4+ is tested and guaranteed to work.

All additional requirements are listed in ``requirements.txt`` file and are
installed automatically using the ``pip install xhtml2pdf`` method.


Development environment
=======================

#. If you don't have it, install ``pip``, the python package installer::

    sudo easy_install pip

   For more information about ``pip`` refer to http://www.pip-installer.org/.

#. I will recommend using ``virtualenv`` for development. This is great to have separate environment for
   each project, keeping the dependencies for multiple projects separated::

    sudo pip install virtualenv

   For more information about ``virtualenv`` refer to http://www.virtualenv.org/

#. Create virtualenv for the project. This can be inside the project directory, but cannot be under
   version control::

    virtualenv --distribute xhtml2pdfenv --python=python2

#. Activate your virtualenv::

    source xhtml2pdfenv/bin/activate

   Later to deactivate use::

    deactivate

#. Next step will be to install/upgrade dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` file::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

#. Run tests to check your configuration::

    nosetests --with-coverage

   You should have a log with success status::

    Ran 36 tests in 0.322s

    OK


Python integration
==================

Some simple demos of how to integrate xhtml2pdf into
a Python program may be found here: test/simple.py


Running tests
=============

Two different test suites are available to assert xhtml2pdf works reliably:

#. Unit tests. The unit testing framework is currently minimal, but is being
   improved on a daily basis (contributions welcome). They should run in the
   expected way for Python's unittest module, i.e.::

        nosetests --with-coverage (or your personal favorite)

#. Functional tests. Thanks to mawe42's super cool work, a full functional
   test suite lives in testrender/.
