About
-----

``pylint-django`` is a `Pylint <http://pylint.org>`__ plugin for improving code
analysis when analysing code using Django. It is also used by the
`Prospector <https://github.com/landscapeio/prospector>`__ tool.


Installation
------------

To install::

    pip install pylint-django


**WARNING:** ``pylint-django`` will not install ``Django`` by default because
this causes more trouble than good,
`see discussion <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/pull/132>`__. If you wish
to automatically install the latest version of ``Django`` then::

    pip install pylint-django[with_django]

otherwise sort out your testing environment and please **DO NOT** report issues
about missing Django!


Usage
-----

Ensure ``pylint-django`` is installed and on your path and then execute::

    pylint --load-plugins pylint_django [..other options..] <path_to_your_sources>


Prospector
----------

If you have ``prospector`` installed, then ``pylint-django`` will already be
installed as a dependency, and will be activated automatically if Django is
detected::

    prospector [..other options..]


Features
--------

* Prevents warnings about Django-generated attributes such as
  ``Model.objects`` or ``Views.request``.
* Prevents warnings when using ``ForeignKey`` attributes ("Instance of
  ForeignKey has no <x> member").
* Fixes pylint's knowledge of the types of Model and Form field attributes
* Validates ``Model.__unicode__`` methods.
* ``Meta`` informational classes on forms and models do not generate errors.
* Flags dangerous use of the exclude attribute in ModelForm.Meta.


Additional plugins
------------------

``pylint_django.checkers.db_performance`` looks for migrations which add new
model fields and these fields have a default value. According to
`Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/migrations/#postgresql>`__
this may have performance penalties especially on large tables. The prefered way
is to add a new DB column with ``null=True`` because it will be created instantly
and then possibly populate the table with the desired default values.

Only the last migration from a sub-directory will be examined!

This plugin is disabled by default! To enable it::

    pylint --load-plugins pylint_django --load-plugins pylint_django.checkers.db_performance


Known issues
------------

If you reference foreign-key models by their name (as string) ``pylint-django`` may not be
able to find the model and will report issues because it has no idea what the underlying
type of this field is. Supported options are::

- ``self`` and ``Model`` - look for this class in the current module which is being examined
- ``app.Model`` - try loading ``app.models`` into the AST parser and look for ``Model`` there


If your ``models.py`` itself is not importing the foreign-key class
there's probably some import problem (likely circular dependencies) preventing referencing
the foreign-key class directly. In this case ``pylint-django`` can't do much about it.
We always recommend referencing foreign-key models by their classes.


Contributing
------------

Please feel free to add your name to the ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst`` file if you want to
be credited when pull requests get merged. You can also add to the
``CHANGELOG.rst`` file if you wish, although we'll also do that when merging.


Tests
-----

The structure of the test package follows that from pylint itself.

It is fairly simple: create a module starting with ``func_`` followed by
a test name, and insert into it some code. The tests will run pylint
against these modules. If the idea is that no messages now occur, then
that is fine, just check to see if it works by running ``scripts/test.sh``.

Any command line argument passed to ``scripts/test.sh`` will be passed to the internal invocation of ``pytest``.
For example if you want to debug the tests you can execute ``scripts/test.sh --capture=no``.
A specific test case can be run by filtering based on the file name of the test case ``./scripts/test.sh -k 'func_noerror_views'``.

Ideally, add some pylint error suppression messages to the file to prevent
spurious warnings, since these are all tiny little modules not designed to
do anything so there's no need to be perfect.

It is possible to make tests with expected error output, for example, if
adding a new message or simply accepting that pylint is supposed to warn.
A ``test_file_name.txt`` file contains a list of expected error messages in the
format
``error-type:line number:class name or empty:1st line of detailed error text:confidence or empty``.

   support for django-restframework (thanks
   `mbertolacci <https://github.com/mbertolacci>`__)

Version 0.6
-----------

-  Pylint 1.4 dropped support for Python 2.6, therefore a constraint is
   added that pylint-django will only work with Python2.6 if pylint<=1.3
   is installed
-  `#40 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/40>`__ - pylint
   1.4 warned about View and Model classes not having enough public
   methods; this is suppressed
-  `#37 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/37>`__ - fixed an
   infinite loop when using astroid 1.3.3+
-  `#36 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/36>`__ - no
   longer warning about lack of ``__unicode__`` method on abstract model

   ``ForeignKey`` transforms, which now work when of the form
   ``othermodule.ModelClass``. This also fixes a problem where an
   inferred type would be ``_Yes`` and pylint would fail
-  `PR #28 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/pull/28>`__ - better
   knowledge of ``ManyToManyField`` classes

Version 0.5.4
-------------

-  Improved resiliance to inference failure when Django types cannot be
   inferred (which can happen if Django is not on the system path

Version 0.5.3
-------------

-  `Issue #25 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/25>`__
   Fixing cases where a module defines ``get`` as a method

Version 0.5.2
-------------

-  Fixed a problem where type inference could get into an infinite loop

Version 0.5.1
-------------

-  Removed usage of a Django object, as importing it caused Django to
   try to configure itself and thus throw an ImproperlyConfigured
   exception.

Version 0.5
-----------

-  `Issue #7 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/7>`__
   Improved handling of Django model fields
-  `Issue #10 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/10>`__ No
   warning about missing **unicode** if the Django python3/2
   compatability tools are used

   Improved handling of Django ImageField and FileField objects
-  `Issue #14 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/14>`__
   Models which do not define **unicode** but whose parents do now have
   a new error (W5103) instead of incorrectly warning about no
   **unicode** being present.
-  `Issue #21 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/21>`__
   ``ForeignKey`` and ``OneToOneField`` fields on models are replaced
   with instance of the type they refer to in the AST, which allows
   pylint to generate correct warnings about attributes they may or may
   not have.

Version 0.3
-----------

-  Python3 is now supported
-  ``__unicode__`` warning on models does not appear in Python3

Version 0.2
-----------

-  Pylint now recognises ``BaseForm`` as an ancestor of ``Form`` and
   subclasses
-  Improved ``Form`` support
-  `Issue #2 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/2>`__ - a
   subclass of a ``Model`` or ``Form`` also has warnings about a
   ``Meta`` class suppressed.
-  `Issue #3 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/3>`__ -
   ``Form`` and ``ModelForm`` subclasses no longer warn about ``Meta``
   classes.
